# Battleship-style guessing game
This was my submission for Declarative Programming (COMP30023) - Project 2. The task was to created a Battleship-style guessing game in Haskell, that will guess 3 ship locations on the grid. Both players (hider and searcher) were implemented and the guesser takes on average 4 guesses to finish.
